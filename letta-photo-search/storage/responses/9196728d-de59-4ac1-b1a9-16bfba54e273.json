The midground reveals calm waters with small waves lapping softly against the shore, reflecting pastel pinks and oranges from the setting sun. In the background, palm trees stand silhouetted against a sky filled with scattered clouds, their shapes outlined by a warm glow that fills most of the upper portion of your view. This serene scene invites you to pause and reflect in its peaceful embrace.",
