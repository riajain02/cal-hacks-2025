# 🚀 DEMO GUIDE - Accessible Photo Search

**Quick guide for running the demo and impressing your audience!**

---

## 🎯 Quick Start (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /Users/mihikabhatnagar/Desktop/hackathon/letta-photo-search
python app.py
```

Then open: **http://localhost:5000**

---

## 🎤 Demo Script (2 minutes)

### 1. **Introduction** (15 seconds)
"This is an AI-powered photo search system designed specifically for blind and visually impaired users. It's powered by intelligent agents using Letta AI and deployed on the Fetch.ai decentralized network."

### 2. **Show Voice Input** (30 seconds)
- Click the microphone button 🎤
- Say: **"dog"**
- Watch as it finds relevant photos
- The system will speak the results back to you

### 3. **Show Semantic Search** (30 seconds)
- Type: **"pet"**
- Notice it finds both the dog AND the cat
- This is because the AI understands "pet" means animals
- Try: **"nature"** - finds mountains, forests, beaches, etc.

### 4. **Show Accessibility** (30 seconds)
- Click any photo card
- Hear a detailed audio description
- Perfect for screen reader users
- Every element is keyboard accessible (try Tab key)

### 5. **Explain the Tech** (30 seconds)
- "Behind the scenes, we have intelligent agents working together"
- "The Letta agent provides semantic search understanding"
- "The Fetch.ai agent enables decentralized deployment"
- "All wrapped in a fully accessible UI with voice support"

## 🎨 Best Demo Queries

Try these to show off different capabilities:

1. **"dog"** - Direct match
2. **"pet"** - Semantic search (finds dog AND cat)
3. **"nature"** - Broad category (finds multiple nature photos)
4. **"work"** - Finds workspace/laptop photos
5. **"sunset"** - Specific scene
6. **"animal"** - Another semantic search
7. **"coffee"** - Direct match
8. **"outdoor"** - Category search

## 🎬 Running Different Components

### Web UI Only (Recommended for Demo)
```bash
python app.py
# Open: http://localhost:5000
```

### Fetch.ai Agent
```bash
python run_agents.py
# Agent will run on port 8001
```

### Both Together
Terminal 1:
```bash
python app.py
```

Terminal 2:
```bash
python run_agents.py
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Quick Test
```bash
python test_real_search.py
```

Should show:
```
✓ PASS: Photo Database
✓ PASS: Flask Dependencies
✓ PASS: Environment Config
✓ PASS: Letta Agent

Results: 4/4 tests passed
```

### API Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "dog"}' | python -m json.tool
```
